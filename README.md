# shellhacks18
Hackathon project for ShellHacks2018

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from one of our member's younger sister's desire for a simple closet app that lays out the clothes she owns.

## What it does
Armadio is a closet website/mobile application that allows users to upload and rate their clothes, check the weather to ensure they wear the right outfit, as well as includes a chat function.

## How we built it
Using Wix.com, we implemented WixCode and JavaScript to create our website.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team had very little to almost no knowledge/experience using Wix.com so this was definitely the biggest hurdle faced in our website development. We also had difficulty with trying to implement a tagging system.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are super proud that we managed to create something using Wix with our limited experience with it.

## What we learned
We learned how to use Wix.com, WixCode and JavaScript. 

## What's next for Armadio
We hope to expand on this project by incorporating machine learning and image recognition where users can take pictures of their clothing items and tags with automatically be generated. Furthermore, by using these tags, we hope to develop the feature of randomization of outfit combinations.

## Built With
Wix.com, WixCode, and JavaScript
